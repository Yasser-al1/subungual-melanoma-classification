# subungual-melanoma-classification
Subungual melanoma is a rare type of skin cancer that occurs under the nails. Symptoms include streaks on the nails, color changes in or around the nail, a bruise under the nail that does not heal, and the nails separating from the nail bed (medicalnewstoday.com). This project is intended to classify nail images into whether they have SM or not.
